# Model Output Data

**Note Output Data will often be too large to host on Github.** 

To access output data for this model, check the M@TE collection on NCI (http://dx.doi.org/10.25914/yrzp-g882), or refer to this model on the M@TE website (http://mate.science)


## Notes:
The model output data is stored in a hdf5 format. You will see a h5 folder and a series of xdmf files. 
- **h5** folder contains the **hdf5** data, all the information computed by the model are stored in these files. You will have at least the *tin* (surface) and *flow* (stream network) dataset and also the *sed* (stratigraphy) data if the stratal structure is computed in your simulation.

- two **.xdmf** files for the surface (**tin_series.xdmf**) and the flow network (**flow_series.xdmf**) that read the **xmf** files through time.
