# Model Code & Inputs

## Notes:
The input and boundary conditions for the model are structured as follows:
an input XML file where the initial and boundary conditions are set
a data folder containing the initial surface and the boundary conditions, in this case different sea-level scenarios
a series of IPython Notebooks used to run the experiment and perform some pre or post-processing tasks.
